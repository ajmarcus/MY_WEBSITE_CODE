        This body of work examines the tight regulation of what comes in and out of my home. My careful management of the interior space is made more potent by the pandemic and recent wildfires. Two types of related imagery dominate these grid paintings. There are grids that, specific to my unique space, may look familiar to others, but are only truly recognizable to me. These grids are my gateways, they’re the windows, the vents, the radios, the ways that light, air, and sound are admitted from the outside into my domain. 
        <br>
        Then there are those items in my space that exist in all our spaces and connect me to the cultural landscape, or the uniformity of our lived experiences. These grids are lined paper, games we all play, forms that we all fill out, symbols that permeate our lives. We may find comfort in these grids or we resent them, but we all know them well.
        <br>
        This project is inspired by Agnes Martin and Vija Celmens. Each painter finds magic in very simple repetitive gestures. Martin’s layered pastel stripes glow and undulate in changing light. In Celmens’ earlier work, mundane household objects are central to profound scenes of domesticity. Her later work is created meticulously, resulting in vibrant scenes from nature that border on abstraction. 
        <br>
        I tasked myself with replicating Martin’s stripes, knowing that I’d inevitably end up somewhere complete different. Stripe painting had an attractive allure because I’m instinctively drawn to the repetitive task of filling, or coloring in predetermined areas. In the varying states of anxiety that COVID fosters, I find that the repetitive motion helps me to slow down and care for small squares, one at a time.
